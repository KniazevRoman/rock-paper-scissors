# Rock-paper-scissors project

This repository is the second project of the Foundations path of the Odin Project self-taught project (https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Odin Project is focused on building knowledge by doing.

The main goal of the "Rock-paper-scissors" project (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) is to build the logic of a game where you can play against a pc.

To start playing simply choose a gesture by clicking/tapping on it. A computer will then randomly choose its gesture and you will see the result of the last game as well as the total score. 

The layout is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
